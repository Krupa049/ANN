# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Project

## Overview

This repository contains various implementations and experiments related to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The project explores different architectures, training methodologies, and applications of ANNs using datasets like the IRIS dataset.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following Jupyter Notebook files:

- **ANN.ipynb**: Contains the base implementation of an Artificial Neural Network.
- **ANN_5_models.ipynb**: Explores five different ANN models with varying architectures and parameters.
- **ANN_BCE.ipynb**: Focuses on training an ANN using Binary Cross-Entropy loss.
- **ANN_Ex.ipynb**: Provides examples and exercises related to ANN training and evaluation.
- **ANN_Exp.ipynb**: Documents experimental results and observations from various ANN configurations.
- **ANN_ML.ipynb**: Integrates machine learning techniques with ANN models.
- **ANN_ML_Linear.ipynb**: Combines linear models with ANN architectures for comparative analysis.
- **DEPTH_WIDTH.ipynb**: Analyzes the impact of network depth and width on ANN performance.
- **IRIS_2.ipynb** & **IRIS_Dataset.ipynb**: Implementations of ANNs applied to the IRIS dataset for classification tasks.
- **Qwerties_3.ipynb**: Investigates a specific ANN model or dataset; details to be added.

## Getting Started

To explore the notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krupa049/ANN.git
   cd ANN
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
